Say goodbye to soggy bread and hello to restaurant-quality results in the comfort of your own kitchen. Elevate your culinary creations and impress your family and friends with this innovative tandoor oven!","<h2>The Professional Mini Electric Tandoor: High-Performance Gastronomy from Stockholm</h2>\nWhen it comes to authentic South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine, the Tandoor oven is the beating heart of the kitchen. At <strong>Anmol Wholesale</strong>, we don't just sell kitchen equipment—we manufacture it. Drawing from over 5 years of real-world experience running our successful sister establishment, <strong>Anmol Sweets &amp; Restaurant</strong> in Stockholm, we have engineered the perfect <strong>Mini Electric Tandoor</strong> designed specifically for the rigors of professional restaurant, café, and bakery environments.\n<h3>Why Every Professional Kitchen Needs an Anmol Mini Tandoor</h3>\nIn a modern commercial kitchen, space and efficiency are just as important as flavor. Traditional clay tandoors are magnificent but often require significant space, specialized ventilation, and hours of pre-heating. Our Mini Electric Tandoor solves these logistical challenges without sacrificing the iconic quality of the bread or meat dishes your customers love. It is the ultimate tool for restaurants looking to add high-margin items like fresh Naan, Roti, and Tandoori appetizers to their menu with minimal footprint.\n<h3>Direct from the Manufacturer: Our Stockholm USP</h3>\nUnlike other wholesale suppliers who simply import and flip generic products, we are the direct manufacturers of this specific unit. Based in our Spånga warehouse (Fagerstagatan 13), we maintain total control over the build quality, safety standards, and spare parts availability. Because we use these exact units in our own restaurant operations, we have optimized the heating elements and insulation to withstand continuous use in high-volume settings. When you buy from us, you are buying a product tested by chefs, for chefs.\n<h3>Unbeatable Wholesale Value: 15% Lower Than Market Average</h3>\nBecause we eliminate the middleman and manufacture our own equipment, we are able to offer this Mini Electric Tandoor at prices typically <strong>15% lower</strong> than the equivalent wholesale market. For a small to medium-sized business, this cost saving translates directly into a faster return on investment (ROI). Whether you are a new start-up bakery in Stockholm or an established catering business in Oslo, our competitive B2B pricing ensures your kitchen is equipped with professional-grade gear without breaking the budget.\n<h3>Logistics and Delivery: Our Owned Scandinavian Service</h3>\nLogistics can be a major headache for wholesale buyers. That is why Anmol Wholesale maintains its own dedicated delivery network. We don't just hand your expensive equipment over to a random courier; we manage the distribution across <strong>Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark</strong> to ensure it arrives in perfect condition.\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Local Pickup:</strong> Visit our warehouse in Spånga to inspect the unit and collect it personally.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Managed Delivery:</strong> Use our fleet for safe, timely ""white-glove"" delivery to your restaurant door.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Flexible Freight:</strong> If you have a preferred logistics partner like DHL, PostNord, or DB Schenker, we can arrange ex-warehouse shipping using your account or ours.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Technical Excellence &amp; Safety</h3>\nThe Anmol Mini Electric Tandoor is built with high-grade stainless steel for easy cleaning and hygiene compliance. The internal heating system is designed for rapid heat recovery, meaning you can serve batches of fresh naan every minute during your peak rush hour. The exterior remains safe to touch compared to traditional charcoal ovens, improving the working conditions for your staff. Its compact size makes it perfect for food trucks, market stalls, and smaller café kitchens that previously thought tandoori cooking was out of reach.\n<h3>Join the Anmol Wholesale Partner Network</h3>\nBy choosing Anmol Wholesale, you are choosing more than a supplier; you are choosing a partner who understands the DNA of a successful restaurant. From the authentic recipes developed at Anmol Sweets to the equipment that brings them to life, we are here to support your growth. Our Mini Electric Tandoor is the cornerstone of that commitment—a locally manufactured, expertly designed solution that delivers the taste of the East with the efficiency of the West.\n\n<strong>Order your Mini Electric Tandoor today and experience the Anmol difference.

Ocean Pearl Basmati Rice is the trusted choice for professional chefs who demand aromatic, extra-long grains that cook to fluffy perfection every time. Sourced for consistency and quality, this 5kg pack is ideal for restaurants, caterers, and retailers focused on delivering an authentic Indo-Pak dining experience.","<h2>Ocean Pearl Basmati Rice: The Gold Standard for Professional Kitchens</h2>\nIn the world of high-volume restaurant catering, the quality of your rice can make or break your reputation. At <strong>Anmol Wholesale</strong>, we understand that a Biryani is only as good as the grain it is built upon. That is why we are proud to offer <strong>Ocean Pearl Basmati Rice in our 5kg Wholesale Pack</strong>—a premium, long-grain basmati specifically selected for its aromatic profile and superior cooking performance in commercial environments.\n<h3>The Chef’s Choice: Aroma, Length, and Fluffiness</h3>\nWhat sets Ocean Pearl apart from generic supermarket brands is its consistency. As experienced restaurateurs running <strong>Anmol Sweets &amp; Restaurant</strong> in Stockholm for over 5 years, we have tested countless varieties of basmati in our own high-pressure kitchen. Ocean Pearl consistently delivers the three ""holy grails"" of professional rice cooking:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>Exceptional Elongation:</strong> The grains double in length upon cooking without breaking, providing that elegant, professional look on the plate.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Distinct Separation:</strong> Each grain remain separate and non-sticky, essential for authentic Biryani and Pulao.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Intoxicating Aroma:</strong> The natural, aged fragrance of authentic Himalayan basmati that fills the dining room the moment the pot is opened.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Wholesale Advantage: 15% Lower Prices for Stockholm Businesses</h3>\nOperating a profitable restaurant in Scandinavia requires a sharp eye on food costs.

Ocean Pearl is aged to perfection, allowing the moisture to evaporate naturally and the starches to stabilize. This aging process is what gives the rice its characteristic firm-yet-tender bite. In our role as your wholesale partner, we ensure that every 5kg bag you receive has been stored in optimal conditions in our temperature-controlled facility in Stockholm.\n<h3>Flexible Logistics across Sweden and Scandinavia</h3>\nWhether you need a single 5kg pack for a small café or a full pallet for a catering chain, <strong>Anmol Wholesale</strong> has the logistics infrastructure to deliver.

We are not just your supplier; we are your fellow industry professionals.\n<h3>Sustainability and Quality Assurance</h3>\nWe take pride in our ""Locally Stocked + Imported"" model.

At <strong>Anmol Wholesale</strong>, we supply professional bakeries and specialty restaurants with <strong>2kg Hjorthornsalt (Baker's Ammonia)</strong>. Essential for iconic recipes like Swedish *drömmar* or specialty South Asian flatbreads, this high-purity leavening agent is the key to creating textures that modern baking powder simply cannot replicate.</p>\n\n<h3>Authentic Heritage from Anmol Sweets &amp; Restaurant</h3>\n<p>At our sister establishment, <strong>Anmol Sweets &amp; Restaurant</strong> in Stockholm, we have used Hjorthornsalt for over 5 years to perfect our traditional bakery items.

Specially formulated for a longer fry life and a higher smoke point, our oil is designed to withstand the intense, continuous heat of industrial deep fryers in busy Swedish restaurants and takeaway outlets.\n<h3>Chef-Approved: The Anmol Sweets Experience</h3>\nFried specialties are a cornerstone of our heritage at <strong>Anmol Sweets &amp; Restaurant</strong> in Stockholm. We have spent over 5 years perfecting the art of the samosa and pakora, and we know that the secret lies in the oil.
